# pibell
A doorbell raspberry pi project that flashes Philips HUE lights and plays a random sound from a given directory when the bell is rung. Optionally, include a pushbullet API key and get a push notification whenever someone rings.

Includes a small webpage that shows logged bell rings and allows for testing the bell and the sounds in the sound directory.
